  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week." target="_blank">NYFW</a> can be both amazingly fun &
    incredibly overwhelming, especially if you've never been. Luckily, Im here to help you out. First, plan out which
    shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're worrying about
    blowing your cash the whole time, you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the
    designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>

  <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

  <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show.
    Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their
    new lines. Also, it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but
    you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
